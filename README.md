# WhereTo

Be both organized and spontaneous about your travels with thise site that keeps track of the destinations you wish to visit, and can give back a destination that matches your search category with the click of a button. I created this as my final capstone for Nashville Software School with only two weeks of time from start to finish.

##Features:
- You can add as many of your own categories as you like to keep track of your destination
- You can quickly jot down at destination with a name, a pic url, an address, and short comment.
- You can autofill the name and address through Google's autocomplete feature.
- Street view through Google Maps is enabled to view locations.
- You can press the random button that gives back a random destination from all your listed destinations.
- You can filter the random button to only give a destination that meets a specified category.
- You can edit all destinations you have listed and mark them as complete when you have visited them.

##Phase Two:
- Be able to select your own categories from a dropdown when adding a new destination.
- Be able to recieve Google place information such as directions or reviews when clicking on Place Details.
- Be able to upload your own photos when you have completed a destination.
- Refactoring of AJAX requests and Google Maps implementation for smoother calls and best practices.

##Known Issues:
- Values sometimes must be refreshed in order to see the change in the view listings.
- Too much content results in skewed styling.
